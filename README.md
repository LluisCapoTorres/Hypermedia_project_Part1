**Project analysis:** 

- **Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expecting to find in your project?** 

The final user is probably someone checking out my profile, like a potential employer, a recruiter, or maybe someone curious about my background in videogame development.  
They’ll be expecting to find all the basics from me: who I am, what I’ve studied, my work experience, my best skills, etc. Basically a digital CV, but cooler.

- **Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis is basically the distribution of the different sections of the CV on the page**

I’ve decided to separate the information in two sections:

1. In the left section there  is all about myself. In There we can find a professional photo, how can someone contact me and my best achievements.  
2. In the right section I’ve decided to write about my education, work experience and skills. In this section on the left there is my education record from 2015 to the present. On the right they can find my work experience and my skills. In the subsection about the skills, there is my level of languages I speak and my aptitudes.

- **Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects**

I went with a dark background for the left section and a white background for the right section. The titles of each section or subsection are gold (\#B27F00). This is a personal page, so I choose a combination of colors that I really like.

* The combination of black/white with gold makes the page more professional and elegant.  
* About the text, I choose the basics: white if the background is black and black if the background is white.  
* 

For inspiration, I looked at modern developer resumes and portfolios on sites like Dribbble and Canva. I took cues from minimalist layouts that use strong typography and clean contrasts.
